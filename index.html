                  <div class="intro_text"> Hello!
                    I am a 2nd-year student at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, specialty in Information Technologies.
                    I like to create things and solve problems, and programming is the perfect tool to implement that.
                    However, at the moment some tasks are too complicated for me, which is why I want to enhance my coding skills, expand my database (know more libraries, algorithms, patterns, etc.), and, of course, put it all into practice to gain the skill of "thinking like a programmer". Why I am a good candidate? I can work in a team, open, creative, and friendly person, not being lost in stressful
                    situations, and often find good non-standard solutions, also if I am interested in
                    something I can spend a lot of time on it without noticing the fatigue.
